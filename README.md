Vivere Agenda is a bot designed to help manage events, bookings, and communication across various departments and 
rooms within a building. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators and users to handle event requests, 
bookings, and calendar management with integration into Google Calendar.
## How to Use

1. **Event Requests**:
   - Users can send event requests which will be verified and approved by admins.
   - After approval, events are added to the Communication Channel and can be updated or removed as needed.

2. **Subscriptions**:
   - Normal users can request event subscriptions. These requests are reviewed by admins and either approved or denied.

3. **Room and Building Management**:
   - Rooms and departments can be created with different event categories. Admins manage the assignments of these categories for each building.

4. **Integration with Google Calendar**:
   - The bot connects with Google Calendar to provide a synchronized view of the scheduled events.

## Permissions and Access Control

- **Admin Controls**:
  - Full access to event and user management functions.
  - Ability to verify users, approve, edit, or remove events, and control room assignments.

- **User Controls**:
  - Normal users have restricted access, needing admin approval for event creation and subscriptions.
